## **Descriptive Prompt** 

![Data Science Jobs Prompt](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_GenAI_Prompt/blob/main/Prompts/Data%20Science%20Jobs%20Prompt.png) 

**Response:** [Data Science Jobs](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_GenAI_Prompt/blob/main/Prompt%20Responses/Data_Science_Jobs_Narrative.pdf) 

**Relevance:** I found the response very detailed. It gave a fair idea of what kind of jobs may be appropriate for me based on my skillset and also helped me understand what I should focus on learning to stay relevant in the future 

**Coherence:** The response was very well structured. It listed several data science roles with skills required and trends for each. At the end it summarized the changing trends and its potential impact on jobs in a simple tabular format 

**Creativity:** The response felt very original and detailed. The structure (in particular of the concluding table on shifting trend and potential impact) felt very creative/informative 

**Accuracy:** The response seemed fairly accurate for the most part. There were some roles like ‘Data Product Manager’ that I have never heard of before and I am not sure how they differ from traditional Product Manager roles. Similarly, it mentioned ‘Data Scientist’ and ‘Product Data Scientist’ as two different roles but the difference wasn’t very clear. These subtle differences make me doubt the accuracy of those couple of roles and it would require additional click-down (reprompting) to understand better 



## **Question Prompt** 

![Financial Management Prompt](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_GenAI_Prompt/blob/main/Prompts/Financial%20Management%20Prompt.png) 

**Response:** [Financial Management](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_GenAI_Prompt/blob/main/Prompt%20Responses/Question_Stock_Market_Investment_and_Portfolio_Diversification.pdf) 

**Relevance:** I found the overall response very basic. The individual answers to my specific questions were good. However, the response did not delve much outside of those questions. I was expecting a response like a financial advisor would provide to a similar question from their clients. For instance, it would have been good if the response provided ideal breakdown/balance of investment across various options. Perhaps, if I had used a combination of descriptive (to provide context) and question prompt then the response would have been better. 

**Coherence:** For the response provided, the structure was very good, with clear benefits, risks and options under well defined headers 

**Creativity:** The response lacked depth and felt very basic question-answer type 

**Accuracy:** The response seemed fairly accurate with my limited knowledge in the domain 



## **Example Prompt** 

![All-Electric Vehicles Prompt](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_GenAI_Prompt/blob/main/Prompts/EV%20Prompt.png) 

**Response:** [All-Electric Vehicles](https://github.com/shruti0209/LearnML_GenAI_Prompt/blob/main/Prompt%20Responses/Electric_Vehicle_Comparison_Low_End_Luxury.pdf) 

**Relevance:** I got a very good comparison of vehicles with clearly stated strengths and opportunities for each vehicle. I like that the list was very relevant and all the vehicles compared were comparable 

**Coherence:** The structure was very simple and easy to follow with a very handy tabular summary at the end

**Creativity:** The prompt was simple and I wasn’t expecting any further depth then what was provided. Nor was there much scope to be creative and original. It was mostly a summary of publicly available reviews 

**Accuracy:** Based on the my recent but limited personal research on this topic, the response seemed fairly accurate
